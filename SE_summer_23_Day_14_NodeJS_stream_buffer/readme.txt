The Lagos State brief is a part of a larger review of social norms, women’s economic empowerment, and policy across six states – Abia, Borno, Edo, Kaduna, Lagos, and Niger – from varied geo-political zones in Nigeria. These states were chosen to reflect diverse contexts among Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) priority states. The full report consisted of a desk review, 36 in-depth interviews (IDIs), and two focus group discussions (FGD) with key stakeholders across the selected states and at the national level.
