        A leader of the Arewa Consultative Forum, on Saturday, called on the Federal Government to arrest and prosecute proponents of interim national government.

He said the agitation, in some quarters, to foist interim government on Nigerians, after Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress had been declared President-elect, was the height of unpatriotism for the country.

The chairman, Kwara State chapter of ACF, Dr Mohammed Ghali-Alaaya, who made the call, while addressing journalists at the Annual Weekend Ramadan Lecture of Kwara State Television Authority, which held in Ilorin, on Saturday, insisted that Nigerians chose their preferred candidate among the array of presidential flag-bearers during the general elections.

He therefore wondered why those canvassing an interim government were yet to come to terms with the reality of that choice.

          Popular singer, David Adeleke, aka Davido, who recently released his fourth album, ‘Timeless’, has said all his collaborations with other artistes turn out to be hits because he always wants other artistes to succeed.

Speaking in an interview with content creator, Bukunmi Adeaga-Ilori, aka Kiekie, the ‘Fia’ crooner said, “I always put in my all. If we do something together, I want the individual to succeed. People just record and feel like they are gods and it should just go itself. Beyonce still promotes her music. Who are you? I just like to give my all if I am working with somebody.”

Speaking on his level of energy, he said it had always been a part of him since he was very young, stating, “I have always had energy since I was young. When I was in school, my teacher used to tell my parents, ‘You guys should stop giving him sugar’. I have always had energy. This break taught me patience. Even when I am flying on a plane, I will have to stand up every two hours to walk around. The energy is just in-built; it’s just natural.”

He also spoke about his goals for the future.

“I don’t think there is a goal for what I am doing. It’s just to keep being successful and helping other people. I am 30 years old and I have been doing this since I was like 16/17 years. I want to sit down and know that even if I haven’t got everything attainable, I have helped someone get everything attainable,” Davido said.
